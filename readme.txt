= How do I know it is secure? =

73% of WordPress sites are vulnerable to attack - and passwords are most likely to blame. Trusona’s passwordless 2FA for WordPress is based on the most secure technology you will ever use.  And now you can experience this level of true security for your WordPress accounts, too.  In this version we added a Trusona ONLY mode in settings.  This feature does not allow to show the user name and password fields.  Setting this page to this mode is the most secure approach.  Only recommended to advanced users.
